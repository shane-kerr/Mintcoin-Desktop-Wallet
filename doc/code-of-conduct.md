# Code of Conduct

## Quick Version

The MintCoin community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all MintCoin community spaces,
including the MintCoinOfficial Telegram group, both online and off.
Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled
from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

Some MintCoin community spaces may have additional rules in place,
which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are
responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

## Definitions

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and
  expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness,
  neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or
  religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and
  practices, including those related to food, health, parenting,
  drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where
  they’re not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual
  descriptions like “\*hug\*” or “\*backrub\*”) without consent or after a
  request to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging
  a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online
  activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
  inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without
  their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from
  intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication. 

The MintCoin community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over
privileged people’s comfort. Administrators reserve the right not to
act on complaints regarding:

* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and
  ‘cisphobia’.
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,”
  “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial.
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive
  behavior or assumptions.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of the MintCoin community,
notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
concerns, please contact the administrators via Telegram. If the
person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse
themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as
we can.

The current administrators are:

* Warren
* Minty All Day
* Deepcreek
* Shane Kerr
* enlil
* (EuroCentiem)-Dev
* DaySandBox

This code of conduct applies to MintCoin spaces, but if you are being
harassed by a member of the MintCoin community outside our spaces, we
still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of
harassment by MintCoin members, especially the administrators,
seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment
that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the
right to exclude people from the MintCoin community based on their
past behavior, including behavior outside of MintCoin spaces and
behavior towards people who are not in the MintCoin community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the
right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted
without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person
about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn
third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase
the safety of MintCoin community members or the general public. We
will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may
take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion
from all MintCoin spaces and identification of the participant as a
harasser to other MintCoin community members or the general public.
